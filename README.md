# Chatbot with Python, Flask, CSS, and JavaScript

This is a simple chatbot application built using Python (Flask) for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The chatbot takes user input through a web interface and provides predefined responses.

## Features

- Web-based chatbot interface.
- Backend powered by Python and Flask.
- Frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Simple user interaction where the bot responds to user input.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone this repository** or download the project files to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
Install the necessary Python packages by running the following command in the project directory:

bash
Copy code
pip install flask
Running the Application
After installing the dependencies, run the Flask application by executing the following command:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
You should see the chatbot interface. You can now enter a message, and the bot will respond.

Project Structure
The project consists of the following files and folders:

app.py: The main Python file that defines the Flask routes and chatbot logic.
templates/index.html: The HTML file that contains the chatbot's user interface.
static/styles.css: The CSS file used to style the chatbot interface.
README.md: This file, containing the project's information and setup instructions.
How It Works
The user enters a message in the input field and clicks "Send".
The message is sent to the Flask server via a POST request.
Flask processes the message and returns a response.
The response is displayed in the chat window as the bot's reply.
You can modify the logic inside the ask() function in app.py to customize the bot's behavior or integrate more advanced AI features.

Customizing the Chatbot
To modify the bot's responses, edit the ask() function in the app.py file. The current setup returns a basic message that echoes the user's input. You can integrate libraries like NLTK, spaCy, or external APIs for more complex conversations.
